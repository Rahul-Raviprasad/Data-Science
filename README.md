## Data science introduction

#### What is data science?
* process and resource optimization
* computational methods
* extracting information from massive amounts of data
* extends and complementing to various data analysis fields like statistics, predictive analysis and data mining.
* extract useful insights used for different needs in business, research etc.

#### What is Big Data?
* Large Volume: Massive Datasets
* Fast Velocity: data moves too fast
* doesn't fit or difficult for traditional RDBMS system to handle

#### Asking the right Questions
In big data analysis, it is very important to ask the right questions
* Is our solution solving a problem? which party does it help?
* what are the benefits?
* how is it being solved?
* where do the data inputs originate from?
* where are the outputs and where do they reside?
* how does it affect the bottom line?

#### Kinds of Data
* Structured data
  1. data stored
  2. data processed
  3. data handled traditionally like RDBMS
* Unstructured data
  1. Doesn't fit structured DB
* Semi Structured data
  1. Doesn't fit structured DB
  2. Structured with tags, useful for creating a form of order and hierarchy in semi structured data.

#### Data Science industry
* Statistician
 Individuals who models and summarizes datasets
* Domain experts
 Subject matter experts
* Computer scientists
Design using algorithms and data structures to use and visualize the data


## Stages
#### Stage 1 Planning/ Preparation
* Obtain data
  - Acquire this data necessary to analyze
  - Various sources can be used
    * Data Streamed on demand
    * Data files from repositories or libraries
    * Data can be generated automatically by physical devices
    * Data generated by the software
* Format and Clean data
  - Can be done by creating scripts
  - Manually by editing data

#### Stage 2 Analysis
* Create and manage scripts for analysis
