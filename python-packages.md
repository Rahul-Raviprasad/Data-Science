## NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.

#### Installation
pip3 install numpy

#### Importing convention:
```Python
import numpy as np
```

## SciPy

SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

#### Installation
pip3 install scipy

#### Importing convention:
```Python
import scipy as sp
```

## Statsmodels
Statsmodels is a Python package that provides a complement to scipy for statistical computations including descriptive statistics and estimation and inference for statistical models.

#### Installation
pip3 install statsmodels

#### Importing convention:
```Python
import statsmodels.api as sm and import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
```

#### scikit-learn
Machine Learning in Python

* Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis
* Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts
* Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
* Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

#### Installation
pip3 install scikit-learn

#### Importing convention:
```Python
import sklearn
```
